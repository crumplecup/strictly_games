//! Blackjack workflow tools with proof-carrying contracts.
//!
//! Each free function carries explicit `Established<P>` precondition proofs
//! and returns `Established<Q>` postcondition proofs.  The compiler enforces
//! the correct call order — you cannot call `execute_play_action` without
//! first having `Established<BetPlaced>`.
//!
//! # Function summary
//!
//! | Function | Pre | Post | Description |
//! |----------|-----|------|-------------|
//! | [`execute_place_bet`] | `True` (implicit) | [`BetPlaced`] | Validates bet, deals initial cards |
//! | [`execute_play_action`] | [`BetPlaced`] | [`PlayerTurnComplete`] or recycled [`BetPlaced`] | Applies one player action |
//! | [`execute_dealer_turn`] | [`PlayerTurnComplete`] | [`PayoutSettled`] | Plays dealer and settles payout via BankrollLedger |
